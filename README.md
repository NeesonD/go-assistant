## Features

- **Modular Design**: Each functionality is encapsulated in its own module, allowing for easy extension and maintenance.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: The system uses an event bus to facilitate communication between modules, enabling asynchronous processing.
- **User Context Management**: Each user session is handled independently, allowing for personalized interactions.
- **Health Monitoring**: The system can monitor health devices and respond to alerts.
- **News Updates**: The assistant can fetch and provide the latest news based on user requests.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-assistant.git
   cd go-assistant
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   go run cmd/main.go
   ```

## Future Enhancements

- Implement additional modules for environment monitoring.
- Add performance monitoring and logging capabilities.
- Enhance the API with more endpoints and functionalities.
- Improve error handling and resilience of the system.
